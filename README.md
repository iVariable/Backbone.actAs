# Backbone.actAs Plugins
==============

Behavioral plugins for backbone.js.
This page/repository is just an aggregator of stand-alone plugins, made for "[documentup](http://documentup.com/ivariable/backbone.actas)" testing purposes. 

## Production ready

### Backbone.actAs.Mementoable

[Memento pattern](http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/memento) realization for Backbone.js models.

### Backbone.actAs.Paginatable

Paginatable backbone collections for large model sets. Request your collections
piece by piece. Very useful for large model sets.

### Backbone.actAs.Configurable

A small mixin for your models/collections/views/objects allowing you to configure them externally
from one config-object.

NB: will be remade soon, as it's not so good, as it used to be :)

## Others

### Backbone.actAs.Locatable

Big registry. Allows you to get your models/collection by special id from anywhere you want.
I used it in some of my apps together with Mementoable plugin for nested objects. 

Don't think it'll be useful for someone else, but may be... :)
